    <h2>Toasted Granola that's easy to tweak</h2>
    <p>This tasty granola is easy to make at home, and is a great way to rationalize bulk grains in your pantry.
        It's easy to tweak, just make sure you add a little more of the wet stuff if you add more dry stuff.
    </p>
    <p>For best results, mix the dry together real well first or else it'll clump up when you add the wet components.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Dry mix:</h4></li>
        <li>3 cups whole oats (the thicker the better)</li>
        <li>1 cup oat bran (wheat bran will work in a pinch)</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut flakes (unsweetened and large flake works best)</li>
        <li>1 cup sunflower seeds (any kind'll do, just make sure they're shelled of course)</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cup chopped almonds (pre roasted is best)</li>
        <li><h4>Wet Mix:</h4></li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li><h4>Final Touch</h4></li>
        <li>1 cup dried cranberries (any dried fruit will do)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 275</li>
        <li>Mix the dry together in a big bowl</li>
        <li>Microwave the wet together for 1 minute, then stir</li>
        <li>Add the wet to dry</li>
        <li>Pour mix into large roasting pan</li>
        <li>Put in over for 20 minutes, then stir</li>
        <li>Put in for another 20, stir</li>
        <li>Take out, turn temp up to 325, stir, and put back in for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove, toss in the 1 cup of dried fruit, and let cool</li>
        <li>Once cooled, bag it up for a tasty treat.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If you add in the dried fruit at the start they get too tough when baked. Best to add at the end as it cools.</p>
