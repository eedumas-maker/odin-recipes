    <h1>The Fastest Popcorn Chicken</h1>

    <h2>You might think it's store bought, because it is</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to lie, I have no idea where the nearest KFC is. 
        But I do know that Fred Meyer (the local Kroger chain) has some amazing frozen popcorn chicken.
        Serve it up with a nice big salad on the side and you've got yourself a somewhat respectable meal.
    </p>

    <h3>The Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A few good handfuls of frozen popcorn chicken</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If needed, buy a bag of frozen popcorn chicken</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425</li>
        <li>Put chicken on a jelly roll pan (something with edges)</li>
        <li>Bake for 6-8 minutes</li>
        <li>Take out and flip each piece</li>
        <li>Bake again for 6-8 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve with sauces of choice, and a nice salad</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>Don't crowd the pieces, or they won't cook as fast. Be sure to turn them even though it's tedious.</p>
